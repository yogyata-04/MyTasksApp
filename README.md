# MyTasksApp

Tech stack used:
- React [frontend library]
- MongoDB [database]
- Express [web framework - ready to use toolbox for building web apps faster]
- Node.js [runtime - allows to run JS on server, originally it was only allowed to run on client like browser]
- Nodemon [automatically restarts the server whenever the file changes]
- Mongoose [Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a schema-based approach to structure application data. It acts as a layer between your Node.js code and MongoDB, offering data validation, relationship modeling, and query building.]

At its core, Mongoose works by:

Connecting to a MongoDB database.

Defining Schemas that describe the structure and constraints of documents.

Creating Models from schemas to perform CRUD operations.

Executing Queries with built-in validation and middleware support.]

### NOTE
- Both in frontend and backend we will be using JS


## Why given tech stack?

### Express
- saves times
- makes code cleaner and more organised
- handles common tasks (like routing, error handling, etc.)
