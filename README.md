# MyTasksApp

Tech stack used:
- React (frontend library)
- MongoDB (database)
- Express (web framework - ready to use toolbox for building web apps faster)
- Node.js (runtime - allows to run JS on server, originally it was only allowed to run on client like browser)

- Both in frontend and backend we will be using JS


## Why given tech stack?

### Express
- saves times
- makes code cleaner and more organised
- handles common tasks (like routing, error handling, etc.)
